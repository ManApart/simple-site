# Simple Site

Slightly extend html in order to build sites that don't require javascript.

WebsiteBuilder builds your files.

To Autoreload, run SiteWatcher

```
npm i -g browser-sync
cd ./out
browser-sync start -s -f .
```
Navigate to localhost:3000


Manually copy your assets and css to the out folder for now
